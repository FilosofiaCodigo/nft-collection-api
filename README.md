## Checklist 📝

Make sure you follow all these steps when launching this API:

1. Upload this project to a linux virtual machine on the cloud (digital ocean, amazon web services etc..)
2. Replace your contract ABI `./Contract.json`
3. Replace your un revealed image on `./unrevealed/image.png`
4. Set the variables on the top of `scripts/start.js`, keep the `IS_REVEALED` variable set to `false` to start the server with _unrevealed mode_
5. Start the server with `npm start`
6. Put all your images and metadata on `./images/` and `./metadata/` respectively
  * Consider using FTP or scp, for example: `scp -r user@ssh.example.com:/path/to/remote/source /path/to/local/destination`
8. run `npm run shuffle`
9. run `npm run remove_none_traits` if needed
10. Upload your images, choose between CGS or IPFS
  * IPFS
    * Run `npm run upload_images_ipfs`
  * Google Cloud Services
    * Put your `gcs.json` keyfile on this project directory
    * Run `npm run upload_images_gcs`
    * Install the google cloud console and run this to open the files in the browser instead of downloading them by downloading the Google Cloud SDK and running this: `gsutil -m setmeta -h "Content-Type: image/png" -h "Content-Disposition: inline;" gs://YOURBUCKETNAME/*`. Remember to set `YOURBUCKETNAME`.
11. Once you want to reveal the Images and Metadata set the `IS_REVEALED` to `true` on `scripts/start.js`, stop and restart the server
